curl -O [setup-environment.sh URL]
chmod +x setup-environment.sh
./setup-environment.sh
Step 2: Copy the Main Files
Copy these files to your ~/rugs-collector/ directory:

persistent-collector.js
analysis-tools.py

Step 3: Test the Collection
bashcd ~/rugs-collector
./start-collector.sh --target 5 --verbose
Step 4: Start Production Collection
bash# Continuous collection
./start-collector.sh

# Or with specific target
./start-collector.sh --target 10000
